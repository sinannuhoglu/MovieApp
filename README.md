## Technologies Used and Their Purpose

| Technology / Library        | Purpose / Usage |
|-----------------------------|------------------------|
| **Kotlin**                  | Primary programming language used for Android development. |
| **ViewModel**               | To store and manage UI-related data independent of lifecycle. |
| **LiveData**                | To observe and automatically update UI based on data changes. |
| **Navigation Component**    | Manages navigation between fragments safely and predictably. |
| **SafeArgs**                | Enables type-safe navigation and argument passing between fragments. |
| **Retrofit**                | For making HTTP requests to fetch data from the TMDb API. |
| **OkHttp & Logging Interceptor** | For logging HTTP request details and handling network calls. |
| **Glide**                   | To load, cache, and display images from the internet. |
| **Glide Transformations**   | Image loading and transformation with Glide. |
| **Coroutines**              | For performing asynchronous operations in a readable way. |
| **TMDb API**                | To retrieve information about movies, cast, and details from TMDb. |


- **Jetpack Components**

## Navigation Flow

- **HomeFragment** → When a movie is selected → **DetailFragment**
- **DetailFragment** → When a cast member is selected → **CastFragment**
